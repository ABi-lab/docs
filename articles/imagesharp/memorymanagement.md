# Memory Management

>ImageSharp seems to retain ~300â€”400 MB of managed memory even after disposing all my images. Is this a memory leak?

By default, ImageSharp uses [ArrayPool's](http://adamsitnik.com/Array-Pool/) for performance reasons, however this behavior is fully configurable. All large buffers are managed by the @"SixLabors.ImageSharp.Memory.MemoryAllocator" implementation associated to @"SixLabors.ImageSharp.Configuration"'s @"SixLabors.ImageSharp.Configuration.MemoryAllocator" property. We are using @"SixLabors.ImageSharp.Memory.ArrayPoolMemoryAllocator" by default, in order to utilize the benefits of array pooling:

- Less pressure on GC, because buffers are being reused most of the time
- Reduced [LOH fragmentation](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/maoni/2016/05/31/large-object-heap-uncovered-from-an-old-msdn-article/)
- When working with unclean buffers is acceptable, we can spare on GC-s array cleaning behavior too

**Summary**: pooling helps us to *reduce CPU work and increase throughput for the cost of a larger memory footprint.*

### Working in Memory Constrained Environments

Sometimes having ~300 MB memory footprint is not an option. Let's mention a few cases:

- When horizontal scaling is achieved by having multiple memory constrained containers in a cloud environment.
- Mobile applications.

Before scaling down pooling behavior because of unwanted `OutOfMemoryException`-s in a cloud or desktop environment:

- Keep in mind that image processing is a *memory intensive* application! This may affect your scaling strategy. We don't recommend using containers with 1 GB or smaller memory limit!
- Make sure that you are running your service in a **64 bit process**!

There are several pre-defined factory methods to create an @"SixLabors.ImageSharp.Memory.ArrayPoolMemoryAllocator" instance for memory constrained environments. For example @"SixLabors.ImageSharp.Memory.ArrayPoolMemoryAllocator.CreateWithModeratePooling" might be suitable in most constrained situations:

```cs
Configuration.Default.MemoryAllocator = ArrayPoolMemoryAllocator.CreateWithModeratePooling();
```

Of course, you may also configure a MemoryAllocator on your own @"SixLabors.ImageSharp.Configuration" instance.

You can find [benchmark results in the original PR](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/pull/475) which may help to select you a configuration, but they are bit outdated, because our throughput has improved since then!

### Releasing Pools Programmatically 

If your application uses ImageSharp sporadically (eg. generating some images on startup, or on other non-frequent use-cases), you may want to release the retained pools using @"SixLabors.ImageSharp.Memory.MemoryAllocator.ReleaseRetainedResources":

```cs
Configuration.Default.MemoryAllocator.ReleaseRetainedResources();
```

### Using Multiple MemoryAllocator Instances in the Same Process

You need to create and maintain your own @"SixLabors.ImageSharp.Configuration" instance, setting a specific MemoryAllocator on it. It's possible to pass custom Configuration instances to methods across our whole API.
